## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Please use requirements.txt for the necessary libraries.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. This repo explores Stack Overflow 2021 Survey data with several questions.

My key interests would be:

1. What is the education level of the participants from USA and Canadaï¼ŸDoes PhD have any advantage over full-time employment?
2.	How People are paid regarding the years of work?
3.	How "Salary" is related to the year of starting to code?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are three files here:

1. StackOverflow 2021 Survey Analysis.ipynb includes all the code and outputs
2. requirements.txt for necesarry libraries (venv is recommended)
3. survey_results_public.csv contains all the survey data
4. survey_results_schema.csv contains survey schema

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](#) available

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and to Stack Overflow for the data.
